Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)

Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of blood against artery walls is consistently too high. It's often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms until serious complications occur.

Blood Pressure Categories:

- Elevated: 120-129/<80 mm Hg
- Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139/80-89 mm Hg

- Hypertensive Crisis: Higher than 180/120 mm Hg (emergency)
